// some notes to take home
sometimes you might want to serve a single file from within a handler. For this there's the
http.ServeFile() function, which you can use like so:

func downloadHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	http.ServeFile(w, r, "./ui/static/file.zip")
}

http.Servefile() does not automatically sanitize the file path. If you're
constructing a file path from untrusted user input, to avoid directory traversal attacks
you must sanitize the input with filepath.Clean() befor using it.

f, err := os.OpenFile("/tmp/info.log", os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE, 0666)

if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

defer f.Close()

infoLog := log.New(f, "INFO\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime)
